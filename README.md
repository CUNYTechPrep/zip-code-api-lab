# Zip Code API Lab

## Project 01: Build the Zip API service

I slightly modified the api functionality:

- Added support for query parameters in zip code searches
- Included all information about the relevant zipcodes in the response in city searches, so that front-end will not have to make a plethora of unnecessary requests
